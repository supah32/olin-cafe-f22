# Multicycle RISC-V CPU
This lab is all about designing a working rv32i (integer subset of the RISC-V spec) system. The overall system (in `rv32i_system.sv`) consists of a computation core (datapath, alu, register file, etc.) and a Memory Management Unit (MMU). The MMU will be critical when we start connecting our CPU to external peripherals, but for now you can treat it as a RAM with one read/write port.

Your task is to implement `rv32i_multicycle_core.sv`. A computational core takes in our typical `clk` and `rst` signals, and can interface with memory via the `mem_addr`, `mem_wr_data`, `mem_wr_ena`, and `mem_rd_data` signals. By convention the core can only read xor write to memory in a given cycle - augmenting it to do reads and writes simultaneously is beyond the scope for this lab but could be useful for a final project around optimizing memory accesses. You should also check `rv32i_defines.sv` - it contains some useful constants from the ISA.

You are allowed to use any mix of behavioral or structural HDL for this lab, but remember that clearly drawing boundaries between your combinational logic (`always_comb`) and your registers/FSMs (`always_ff`) makes debugging much easier. 

*Warning* - the textbook's figures in Chapter 7 intentionally omit a lot of hardware (or show smaller muxes/decoders than are actually required). Use the readings as a guide, not an exact blueprint! I recommend sketching out the datapath (flow of signals between PC, the register file, the ALU, and the memory) for each type of instruction, updating it as you create more signals, muxes, decoders, etc. You may find it helpful to refer to the more detailed description of the instruction set in Chapter 6, though the reference card is included in this folder. For full detail you can refer to the [Official RISC-V Manual](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf)


## Assembler
To test a CPU you need a populated instruction memory. I've provided a simple python assembler (`assembler.py`), please skim the file and its usage in `Makefile` before proceeding. `assembler.py` generates `memh` files (ascii hex) that can be loaded by our simulation and synthesis tools.

There is also a `disassembler.py` file, you may find that useful for debugging but I mostly just included it for completeness (it's how I tested the assembler.)


## Running Tests
The `Makefile` uses some extra arguments and dependencies to first run the assembler to make a `memh` file, then run `iverilog` with a special flag to load the right assembly into instruction memory. The various `make test_rv32i_*` targets are a suggested flow toward implementing a complete core. After running a test you can use `make waves_rv32i_system &` to visualize the results. 

The `mmu` will also dump out the various sub-memories into `mmu_*.out` - these are optional but useful when validating your load and store instructions.


## Suggested Timeline
Designing your own CPU from scratch is both challenging and rewarding. I've provided a very minimum scaffolding here, but have intermediate solutions available on request (e.g. a core with r-types implemented that you can use as an example to build up to more instructions.)

- Before the break - read through the provided stub, assembler, etc.
- Monday - 11/28 - implement at least a few I and R type instructions.
- Wednesday - 11/30 - required I and R types done, start working on loads and stores.
- Monday - 12/5 - required loads and stores done, work on branches.
- Wednesday - 12/7 - get at least one branch working. 
- Monday - 12/12 - Final submission due, though ideally you've wrapped up earlier so you can focus on your final project!

# Final Deliverable
The MVP for this project is a core that works in simulation, but I recommend pushing for a synthesizable core that can communicate with peripherals. Instructions for that part will be available after the break.

You can use `make analyze_rv32i_system` to generate a variety of reports showing timing and area results of your design - you should look through those and identify what your critical path is (and what your fastest clock speed is) as well as see what percentage of the FPGA resources you are using. 

Your submission should include any extra tests you've run, as well as sketches/block diagrams showing the main multicycle FSM as well as the datapaths for a few R, I, memory, and branch instructions. To make grading easier, mark off the instructions you have implemented on the list below before submitting.
